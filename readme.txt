Program runs with:
Package: main
Class: Main
Method: main()

Since this is a prototype and we have not implemented user logins, or the patient DB (to read in previously made Users and Patients, nor can we save them yet), there are pre-made objects for each of the user types: Administrator, Doctor, Pharmacist, Nurse, and patients.

All of the medications are imported from the "Medication.txt" file

Test Classes are in the package "test"
